- Jekyll
- Bundler

### Setup

   ```sh
   https://github.com/m-pasima/tech.io.git
   cd tech
   ```

2. **Install Jekyll and Bundler**:
   ```sh

   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```

### Customization

To customize the site with your own information:

1. **Replace the content**: Edit the `index.md` file to update the personal details, skills, projects, and experience with your own information.
2. **Update the logo**: Replace `logo.png` in the root directory with your own logo image. Adjust the size in `index.md` if needed.
3. **Modify the layout**: You can update the `_config.yml` file to change the site's title, description, and other configurations.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

To deploy the site, push your changes to your repository on GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository.

2. **Push your local changes to the new repository**:
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository>.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
   - In the "GitHub Pages" section, select the source as `main` branch.
   - Save your changes. Your site should be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository>/`.

### Enabling Branch Protection

To secure your repository, you can enable branch protection to prevent unauthorized changes to the main branch:

1. **Go to the repository settings**:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the `Settings` tab.

2. **Access the Branches settings**:
   - In the left sidebar, click on `Branches`.

3. **Add a branch protection rule**:
   - Under `Branch protection rules`, click on `Add rule`.
   - In the `Branch name pattern` field, type `main` (or the name of your default branch).

4. **Configure the branch protection rule**:
   - Select the protections you want to enable, such as:
     - Require pull request reviews before merging
     - Require status checks to pass before merging
     - Require branches to be up to date before merging
     - Include administrators (if you want to enforce these rules for admins as well)

5. **Save the branch protection rule**:
   - Click on `Create` or `Save changes` to apply the protection rules to your branch.
