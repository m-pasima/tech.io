## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A modern web browser is all you need to run the site locally. Optionally install Node.js if you plan to extend the React code

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/m-pasima/tech.io.git
   cd tech.io
   ```

2. **Preview locally**:
   Open `react-portfolio/index.html` directly in your browser or run a simple server:
   ```sh
   npx serve react-portfolio
   ```

### Customization

1. **Edit content**: Update `react-portfolio/app.js` and `react-portfolio/index.html` with your own information.
2. **Change styles**: Modify `react-portfolio/style.css` to tweak the look.
3. **Update the logo**: Replace `logo.png` in the root directory with your own image.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically publish the contents of `react-portfolio` to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### Enabling Branch Protection

To secure your repository, you can enable branch protection to prevent unauthorized changes to the main branch:

1. **Go to the repository settings**:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the `Settings` tab.

2. **Access the Branches settings**:
   - In the left sidebar, click on `Branches`.

3. **Add a branch protection rule**:
   - Under `Branch protection rules`, click on `Add rule`.
   - In the `Branch name pattern` field, type `main` (or the name of your default branch).

4. **Configure the branch protection rule**:
   - Select the protections you want to enable, such as:
     - Require pull request reviews before merging
     - Require status checks to pass before merging
     - Require branches to be up to date before merging
     - Include administrators (if you want to enforce these rules for admins as well)

5. **Save the branch protection rule**:
   - Click on `Create` or `Save changes` to apply the protection rules to your branch.
